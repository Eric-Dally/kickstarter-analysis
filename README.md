# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Organized date using a pivot table based on the campaign outcomes. 
Created chart to visualize the relationship between the outcomes and launch month. (see below)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

o	Organized data by goal, outcome, and success percentage.
o	Used COUNTIFS function in excel to order data by twelve different goal ranges
o	Created a line chart titled "Outcomes Based on Goal" to visualize the relationship between the goal-amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

o	One challenge I faced was learning how to use the COUNTIFS function. I found a useful article (https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-countifs-function), which broke down how the function worked. Based on this article I was able to apply the function to my own project. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82424250/116789332-f39c4d80-aa73-11eb-87fc-c17fee738c0f.png)

## Results

•	Theater projects launched between May and June had the highest rate of success and projects launched between November and December had the lowest rate of success compared to other months. 
•	Projects with smaller goals had a higher percentage of success. For example, goals less than $1,000.00 had a success percentage of 76% while goals greater $45,000.00 has a success percentage less that 20%.
•	The dataset only describes 2010 through 2017. In addition, it only accounts for theater projects funding plays. Other theater projects such as musicals and spaces were not included. 
•	We could create graphs and pivot tables describing each donation. By charting the number of backers by the average donation, one could get a sense of how much people are willing to donate for these projects.
